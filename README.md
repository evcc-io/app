# evcc Companion App

Native app wrapper for evcc UI based on [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/). It uses [UI Kitten / Eva](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) as a design system. Native parts are written in TypeScript and kept to a minimum.

## Known limitations

- No support for multiple instances [#3](https://github.com/evcc-io/app/issues/3)
- mDNS discovery only supports HTTP [#1](https://github.com/evcc-io/app/issues/1)

We'll work on these in a future release. Feel free to vote üëç to help priorization and add new feature ideas.

## Development

Ensure that you've Node.js and NPM installed. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Follow the expo instructions to run local simulators for [iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) and [Android](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).

Start dev mode to get into an interactive development environment.

```bash
npm run start
```

Or start iOS, Android or Web simulator directly.

```bash
npm run ios
npm run android
npm run web
```

You can test basic auth locally by with a [caddy server](https://caddyserver.com):

```bash
caddy run
```

It will open a server on http://localhost:7080 with `admin:secret` as basic auth credentials and forward requests to your local evcc instance 7070.
