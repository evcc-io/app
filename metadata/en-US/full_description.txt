What is evcc?
evcc is an open-source software that runs at your home. It is compatible with many PV and battery systems and controls your EV charger - regardless of manufacturer. If your car has an online interface, you can also use smart controls like charging schedules, minimum charging, and charging limits. Additionally, it supports dynamic electricity tariffs, smart plugs, balcony solar systems, and small home batteries.
